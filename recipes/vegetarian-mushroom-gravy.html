    <h1>Veggie Mushroom Gravy</h1>
        <p>
        This gravy is sure to please any vegetarian or even non-vegetarian. It's flavorful, rich, and is as good on turkey or prime rib as it is on a vegetarian meatloaf or mashed potatoes. It can be made in advance, stored in the fridge, and reheated on the stovetop or in the microwave.

            <li>3 tablespoons shallot, minced</li>
            <li>12 ounces baby bella mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sherry</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 cups vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried tarragon</li>
            <li>3 spoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>

        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>
                Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add shallot and cook, stirring occasionally, until shallots are a deep golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in mushrooms, garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are nicely browned, 3 to 5 minutes.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Pour sherry into the pan and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook and stir until sherry is reduced, about 2 minutes. Remove mushroom mixture from the skillet and set aside.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Reduce heat to medium-low and melt remaining 3 tablespoons of butter in the skillet. Add flour to make a roux, stirring continuously, until mixture is light golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add vegetable broth and tarragon; whisk until gravy is smooth and no lumps of flour remain.
            </p></li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Increase heat to medium-high, return mushroom mixture to the skillet, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until mixture has reduced, about 8 minutes. Stir in soy sauce. Adjust seasonings, if necessary.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Cook's Note:</h3>
    <p>If reheating, add a bit more broth to thin out the gravy if necessary.</p>
